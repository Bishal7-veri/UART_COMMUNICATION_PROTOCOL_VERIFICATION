# UART_COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL_VERIFICATION1

UART means Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter Protocol. UART is used for serial communication from the name itself we can understand the functions of UART, where U stands for Universal which means this protocol can be applied to any transmitter and receiver, and A is for Asynchronous which means one cannot use clock signal for communication of data and R and T refers to Receiver and Transmitter hence UART refers to a protocol in which serial data communication will happen without clock signal. 
Pros of UART Protocol
It is having less physical interfacing based on only two lines.  
Simple to configure data and data size. Speed is also configurable. In the majority of cases, this baud rate is 9600 for the UART protocol. Full duplex mode configuration is possible by using two wires so that is the major advantage of UART. 
Error detention is possible
Cons of UART Protocol
UART is having serial communication, therefore, it has less speed.
Start bit, stop bit, and the parity bit is other overhead.  
Since this is asynchronous communication so here there are many things that we need to do in configuration, for instance, we should configure both devices at the same speed because the clock signal is absent.
