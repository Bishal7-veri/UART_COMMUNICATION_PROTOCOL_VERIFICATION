# UART_COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL_VERIFICATION1

UART means Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter Protocol. UART is used for serial communication from the name itself we can understand the functions of UART, where U stands for Universal which means this protocol can be applied to any transmitter and receiver, and A is for Asynchronous which means one cannot use clock signal for communication of data and R and T refers to Receiver and Transmitter hence UART refers to a protocol in which serial data communication will happen without clock signal.
